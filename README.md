# nxdk-rs

nxdk-rs aims to provide a set of bindings and a build system to allow Rust programs to run on the Original Xbox, through the use of [nxdk](https://github.com/XboxDev/nxdk).

nxdk-sys consists of bindings generated by bindgen, as well as a build script that links against the nxdk. It is re-exported by nxdk-rs.

## Usage

nxdk-rs requires that [nxdk](https://github.com/XboxDev/nxdk) is installed somewhere on your system. If you don't already have it, then clone it along with this repo:

```sh
git clone --recursive https://github.com/XboxDev/nxdk
git clone https://github.com/antangelo/nxdk-rs
```

You'll also need Rust nightly installed:

```sh
rustup install nightly
rustup component add rust-src --toolchain nightly-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu
```

Ensure that you follow the nxdk installation instructions. In particular, you'll need to run the activation script:

```sh
./nxdk/bin/activate
```

At this point, you can build one of the nxdk-rs samples:

```sh
cd nxdk-rs/examples/helloworld
make
```

With any luck, you should see the `bin.iso` and `bin/default.xbe` output. FTP the xbe to a real Xbox, or run the iso from xemu directly:

```sh
xemu -dvd_path bin.iso
```

## License

Do note that licenses for any nxdk module(s) that are used are also applicable. Under the current build system, all
nxdk libraries are statically linked, meaning that all associated licenses will apply to the final binary.
